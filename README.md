# End-to-End Fraud Detection Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model to identify fraudulent transactions based on customers' credit card transaction records.

## Main Steps

1. **Data Ingestion:** Obtain and collect the necessary data sources, such as credit card transaction records, for analysis.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Implement data preprocessing techniques such as data cleaning, missing value imputation, and scaling to prepare the data for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and characteristics of the data. This step involves data visualization, summary statistics, and identifying patterns or anomalies in the data.

4. **Feature Engineering:** Preprocess the data and engineer relevant features that will be used to train the machine learning model. Feature engineering may include normalization, transformation, encoding categorical variables, and creating new features to enhance model performance.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Develop modules for evaluating model performance, including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.

6. **Model Interpretability:** Integrate modules for interpreting model predictions and understanding feature importance to gain insights into the factors contributing to fraudulent transactions.

## Model Training

Train machine learning models using the engineered features to predict fraudulent transactions accurately. This step involves selecting appropriate algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and evaluating model performance using relevant metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Deployment

Deploy the trained machine learning model using AWS cloud services for scalability and reliability. Implement engineering best practices for production deployment to ensure the model performs efficiently in real-time environments.
